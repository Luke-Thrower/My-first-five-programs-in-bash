# My-first-five-programs-in-bash

This selection of files are the scripts for five bash programs built as part of the freecodecamp - learn relational database course.

The programs are: 

A countdown timer.

A Fortune Teller.

A bingo caller.

A questionnaire. 

And a script which runs all the four in order.
